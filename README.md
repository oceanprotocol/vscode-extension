# Ocean Protocol VSCode Extension

Run Compute-to-Data jobs on Ocean Protocol directly from VS Code.

The extension streamlines project creation, job submission, monitoring, and results retrieval.

Create a new project with built-in algorithm templates and dependencies, then click **Start FREE Compute Job**.

## Features

### üöÄ One-Click Compute Jobs

Create new compute projects with automatic Dockerfile and dependencies setup. Choose between Python or JavaScript templates.

### üí∞ Free Compute Jobs

Start with free compute jobs, then upgrade to paid compute for more power.

### üìä Real-Time Monitoring

Track job progress and view algorithm logs directly in VS Code's Output console.

### üìÅ Automatic Results Handling

Results and logs are automatically saved in your project folder when your job completes.

## Getting Started

1. Install the extension from the VS Code Marketplace
2. Open the Ocean Protocol panel from the activity bar
3. Create a new project folder:
   - Choose a parent directory for your project
   - Name your project (default: `new-compute-job`)
   - Select your language: Python or JavaScript
4. Explore your project structure:
   - Algorithm file (`.py` or `.js`)
   - Dockerfile with environment setup
   - Dependencies file (`requirements.txt` or `package.json`)
5. Click **Start FREE Compute Job**
6. Monitor job status and logs in the Output console
7. Check results and logs in your project's `results` folder

### Requirements

VS Code 1.96.0 or higher

### Extension Layout

The extension adds a dedicated Ocean Protocol section to the activity bar. Here you can:

- Optionally select a dataset file.
- Create new project folders or select existing ones
- View compute resources under the Setup dropdown
- Configure compute settings (accessible via Configure Compute)
- Start free or paid compute jobs

### Starting a Compute Job

1. Create a new project folder or select an existing one
2. Review your algorithm, Dockerfile, and dependencies
3. Click **Start FREE Compute Job** (or upgrade to paid for more resources)
4. Monitor job status and logs in the Output console
5. Check results in your project folder under `results/`

## Advanced Setup

- **Custom Docker Image/Tag**: Use your own docker image and tag (only if no Dockerfile is provided in your project folder)
- **Auth Token**: Auto-generated when you configure your compute settings
- **Custom Compute Node**: Enter your own node URL or use the default Ocean Protocol node
- **Compute Resources**: Free compute uses minimal resources. View available resources under the Setup dropdown
- **Paid Compute**: Upgrade from free to paid compute for more computational power
- **Node Status Check**: Use the Check button under Setup dropdown to verify node availability

## Troubleshooting

- **Job cannot start** ‚Üí Check node status (under Setup dropdown, press the Check button)
- **Job not running** ‚Üí Verify your Node URL in Configure Compute
- **Not enough funds** ‚Üí Use Configure Compute to adjust your settings or switch to free compute
- **General issues** ‚Üí Check extension logs in the Output console. Logs are also saved in your project folder under `logs/`
